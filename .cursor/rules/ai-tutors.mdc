# AI AGENTS — rules for creating AI agents (tutors)

Agent behavior is consistent with the project goal defined in shared.

# Context

AI Agents (tutors)
- agent does not generate controversial content
- agent operates only within the educational scope
- Agent acts as a teacher for teenagers
- Agent responds briefly, precisely, and in an educational way
- Does not generate controversy
- Does not touch on sensitive topics
- Has a style suited to the teenager's level
- Each agent has its own folder + config:
  /agents/mathTutor
  /agents/englishTutor
  etc.

# Agent structure

The agent folder must contain:
config.ts — personality and constraints
prompts.ts — system prompts + response style
index.ts — functions for API interaction
types.ts — data types

# API

- Use only the API we have chosen (Mistral).
- Do not add new libraries.
