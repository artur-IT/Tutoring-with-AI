# Testing

- Use Vitest and Playwright for testing.
- Write unit tests for all services and utilities.
- Use React Testing Library for components.
- Each new component must include at least 1 test file.
- Never mock things unnecessarily; only mock network requests.
- Add only minimum necessary tests
