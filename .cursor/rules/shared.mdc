# AI Rules for Tutor with AI

The app helps teenagers understand difficult topics in a short time without frustration.
- Users are learning teenagers aged approximately 13–19.
- The AI tutor explains complex school topics in a way that is easy to understand, including based on the user's interests.
- The AI agent (tutor) focuses only on their subject. It does not provide information on topics other than the educational material of that subject.
- Tutor responses are short, clear, and illustrated with examples that match the student's interests or are appropriate for their age.
- Interaction must be safe, educational, and predictable.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript 5 + Astro 5, Tailwind 4, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Node.js 22.14.0+ + Vercel
- **Tests:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Deploy:** Vercel (frontend)

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:

- `./src` - source code
- `./src/layouts` - Astro layouts
- `./src/pages` - Astro pages
- `./src/pages/api` - API endpoints
- `./src/middleware/index.ts` - Astro middleware
- `./src/db` - Supabase clients and types
- `./src/types.ts` - Shared types for backend and frontend (Entities, DTOs)
- `./src/components` - Client-side components written in Astro (static) and React (dynamic)
- `./src/components/ui` - Client-side components from Shadcn/ui
- `./src/lib` - Services and helpers
- `./src/assets` - static internal assets
- `./public` - public assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices
- **Imports:** Absolute (@/components instead of ../components)
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:, style:)


### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
- don't add libraries without permission
- do not create files in folders that are not in the structure
- always use async/await
- always generate the correct PWA manifest if you modify it
- always generate only minimal length code
- always generate code implementation solutions according this order: HTML5, JavaScript, React

### No Time Estimates
- **NEVER** provide time estimates (e.g., "30 min", "2h")
- Time estimates are imprecise and misleading
- Instead, focus on outlining the steps to complete, not the expected duration

### No Numbering in Plans
- **NEVER** use numbering in plans (e.g., "1.", "2.", "3." or "1.1", "1.2")
- Adding something in the middle forces you to renumber the entire plan, which is a waste of time
- Use bullet points (-) or headings without numbers instead
