### Commit Push PR

Review all changes in the repository.

1. Split changes into logical commits (max 3)
2. Write commit messages in Conventional Commits format (as in shared)
3. Create a branch with a sensible name (feature/..., fix/..., chore/...)
4. Push to remote
5. Create a PR with:
   - Summary (2–3 sentences)
   - Changes (bullet points)
   - Testing (how to test)

Use git and gh CLI.
